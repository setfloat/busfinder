# busfinder
Web Development Q1 Project

This project was my quarter one project in the Galvanize web develoment immersive.  The intent of the project was to utilize emerging javascript, jquery, html, and css skills to create a site that called an API and showed some functionality.

Busfinder utilizes the Google Maps API and the One Bus Away API to merge the benefits of both onto one map.  The problem is Google Maps will show when a bus is scheduled to arrive, while One Bus Away has the actual time.

Using the two APIs I found a way for a user to click on a bus stop on a Google Map and then subsequently call the One Bus Away API to generate the correct arrival time of the next bus.  This project used MaterializeCss to provide design components and encourage design best practices.
