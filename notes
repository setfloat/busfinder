Name: Out the Door

Problem: Getting the realtime next bus for a stop on google Maps.

Who has this problem: Everyone has this problem. Me.


APIs:
  One bus away
  Google maps
  Google places

How the APIs work:
  Google map loads
  Map logs click
  JS converts location to Lat/Long
  OBA returns stopId based on Lat/Long
  OBA returns next bus info using stopId
  Card Generates pulling data from:
    OBA
    google

Technologies:
  HTML
  CSS
  JavaScript
  AJAX/JSON

Feedback:
  Using the map instead of the pregenerated stop list.

Biggest Challenge:
  CORS roadblocked my weekend
